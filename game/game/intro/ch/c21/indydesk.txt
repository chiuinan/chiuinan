名稱：瓊斯博士視窗大冒險 (Indiana Jones and His Desktop Adventures，中文版)
簡介：Lucas 1996年出品的動作冒險解謎遊戲，由松崗修改成中文版。每次遊
      戲的地圖與謎題都不一樣，和百戰迷宮有異曲同工之妙。謎題並不難，
      一般直覺便可解出，而且遊戲還附有全中文操作手冊，上手相當容易。
      只是戰鬥的動作不易操控，是本遊戲最大的缺點。整體而言，這個遊戲
      簡單而又有趣，雖然謎題不像一般Lucas出品的冒險遊戲那麼難，但也
      頗值得一玩。
保護：無。
限制：只能在Windows系統上執行。
備註：遊戲手冊檔名為DESKHELP.DOC，需用MS-Word開啟。

Indiana Jones and his desktop adventures 
randomly generates quests every time you

bar is Jose's market.  A little to the south 
east of Jose's is Indy's temporary home.


Indy's health meter is divided into four colors:
Green  ----- When the meter is all green, Indy is at 100%.
Yellow ----- Indy might want to heal soon.

General Hints and Tips
----------------------
When you walk into Marcus Brody's house, 
go to the refrigerator in the left room.
Push up against the fridge to get a First 
Aid Kit.


Jose will only give you Yerba Buena if your 
life meter has dropped significantly.
(Also, he will not give you any if you already 
have some in your inventory.)


If you talk to Gabriela, the barmaid, 
sometimes she will give you bananas or 
tequila.  Both are random occurrances.  
(Bananas heal you and tequila hurts you.)


Moving blocks, stools, rocks, boulders, and 
other things around often yields useful items.


The map is almost always within one screen of the town.


Teleporters can make traveling (or travelling) in larger
maps more manageable.  Teleporters look like + signs on
Indy's map.
